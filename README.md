## **Installation Guide**
You need to have Node.js and MySQL installed in order to use this app.

To install, clone the repository, open an integrated terminal in it, and then install the packages by typing npm i in the terminal.

Once installation is finished, navigate to the db folder in your command line, log into your MySQL and run the schema file by inputting source schema.sql into the terminal. This will create the database employees_db where all your employee information will be stored.

Note: If you already have a database  called employee_db created, it will overwrite it.

If you need to name the database something other than employees_db, you will have to go into the server.js and schema.sql files and replace all instances of employees_db with whatever you want the database to be named.
